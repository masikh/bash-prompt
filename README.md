# bash-prompt

An shell environment file that shows:

- username and hostname
- your path (truncated) 
- number of jobs running in this shell
- amount of files current directory
- disk usage in current directory

The shell prompt has a blueish dot if the return code of the last command was 0 otherwise it will notify you that the last command existed erroneously with a subtle red dot (see screenshot).
